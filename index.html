            <h3>Student & Software Engineer</h3>

            <p>
                Welcome! I’m Seth Keenan, a computer science student and software engineer passionate
                about building reliable, user-friendly software.
            </p>

            <p>
                My goal is to design and develop software solutions that solve real problems and create
                meaningful impacts. As a computer science undergraduate graduating in 2026, I combine
                strong technical foundations with hands-on industry experience gained through my role as
                a software engineer at Shelter Insurance.
            </p>

            <p>
                I enjoy backend development, web technologies, and creating systems that balance
                performance, scalability, and usability. This portfolio highlights my academic journey,
                professional experience, and personal projects that reflect my growth as a developer and
                continuous self-improvement.
            </p>
